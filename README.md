## Features
* **Shallow and deep colors**
* **Foam**, both *simple* and *advanced*
* **Transparency and distortions**
* **Waves**
* **Caustics**
* **Mobile optimized!**

### Toggleable Features
* **Distortions** - simulates refraction by reading from opaque texture using distorted UV, **expensive**. *Requires Opaque Texture to be enabled.*
* **Caustics**
* **Waves**
* **Foam Type** - simple or advanced. Simple is cheap, advanced is expensive, but gives you much more control.

## Important Notes
### Compatability
The shader is tested only in **Unity 2021** and only with **URP**, so I cannot guarantee it will work properly in earlier versions of Unity or different render pipelines.
### URP Settings
Please make sure that **Depth Texture** and **Opaque Texture** are enabled in your URP settings. Without it the shader will work incorrectly.
